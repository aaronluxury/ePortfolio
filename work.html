                            <p>When I look out and view what American history social movements have used powerful and very different strategies to confront systemic inequality and how they go about change. Two of the big movements I wanted to explore more were the Labor Union Movement (1870s–1950s) and the Environmental Justice Movement (1980s–present). Even though they are separated by nearly a century and focused on very different goals the workers' rights in the former and environmental both demonstrate how minority groups organize and push for lasting change due to unfair institutions and inequality at those times so it does not progress to get worse.</p>
                            
                            <p>First, I thought it was interesting that the Labor Movement's fight for fair wages and safer working conditions during industrialization really did lay the foundation and groundwork for many organizing strategies still in use today. I also think the Environmental Justice Movement has brought attention to environmental racism and the unequal distribution of ecological risks in minority communities.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Labor Movement emerged during one of America's most intense periods of industrial growth, it started when unregulated capitalism led to very dangerous working conditions and a lot of economic inequality. According to historian David Montgomery in "The Fall of the House of Labor, Factory workers in the late 19th century often endured 14-hour days in dangerous environments, with industrial accidents frequently resulting in serious injury or death.</p>
                            
                            <p>The movement developed through three main phases. As Zieger stated, "The Knights of Labor was formed in 1869, and the first major national organization, but its attempt to include all workers regardless of skill level eventually limited its effectiveness." More radical groups like the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), founded in 1905, employed militant strategies such as general strikes and factory takeovers to create change.</p>
                            
                            <p>While the Labor Movement did start to address the workplace exploitation, the Environmental Justice Movement came up to fight ecological racism and the disproportionate exposure of minority communities to environmental hazards. "The movement is often traced back to 1982, because this was when residents of Warren County, North Carolina, a mostly Black community, protested the dumping of PCB-contaminated soil in their area by physically blocking incoming trucks."</p>
                            
                            <p>I do see that both movements developed compelling rhetorical strategies to their respective eras. The Labor Movement emphasized solidarity and collective struggle. The IWW's slogan, "An injury to one is an injury to all," exemplifies this message. This showed how united they were and how the group was willing to stand together to make their point heard.</p>
                            
                            <p>Ultimately, these movements remind me that meaningful change doesn't come from the top down and the rich people and policy makers it must be demanded by those most affected, and a lot are toward the bottom and need the help. As the country does face new challenges like climate change and labor exploitation in the digital age and all the problems social media has brought, the tactics and lessons of past movements remain just as relevant.</p>

                            <p>In the novel The House on Mango Street by Sandra Cisneros is a very impactful story that demonstrates a Latina girl named Esperanza living in Chicago and having to face a lot of adversity. First, Esperanza is a young Latina girl, so she is already subject to heavy discrimination in a place like Chicago. She starts their optimistic but soon learns what the real world is like and how people are really treated, especially the different minorities.</p>
                            
                            <p>As she goes through life in Chicago and learns how big of an affect income and economic state really is. She learns about poverty and how bad it is in the area she is and how it literally "defines" people in the country and how much respect they will give you. Income inequality is such a dividing factor in our country and even around the world, it is a shame that it is viewed so heavily, and people feel that your title and job and income is somewhat a result of who you are and how much respect to show you incase you can help them.</p>
                            
                            <p>In House on Mango Street, Esperanza learns that people judge very harshly on gender and treat a certain gender with more respect and opportunity than another. Esperanza deals with gender inequality and how women are viewed and mistreated. She experiences the lack of opportunity in the job market and how there was such a difference for the standard of men then women.</p>
                            
                            <p>Furthermore, Esparanza must deal with race issues being a Latina woman in a majority white country. She learns that not only her, but all minorities are treated unfairly compared to whites and they are not only respected less but prevented a lot less opportunities. She notices how racist the world is and how people judge very bad based on skin type.</p>
                            
                            <p>When Esperanza does see this, she wants to move up and escape by saying, "I want to be like the waves on the sea, like the clouds in the wind, but I'm me. One day I'll jump out of my skin. I'll shake the sky like a hundred violins." She uses this quote to move up and break free of her circumstances and really become the independent person she wants to become.</p>
                            
                            <p>The House on Mango Street was very informative and a good eye opener to see what society is wrong and how is so divisive. When seeing how Esperanza had to go through all the issues with not only being in poverty which is very difficult. She also went through being a Latina woman in a country ran by "White men" which did not help her feel welcomed.</p>

                                <h4>Brand Recognition Analysis</h4>
                                <p>One of my favorite brands is not on the list at all, which really surprised me. I thought for sure that the brands I use and are familiar with would be on the list. I think it surprised me as well that not even my favorite brands, but I only recognized a handful of brands on that whole list. Two brands I use and like a lot are Porsche and Audi, two great German car companies. I was surprised to see General Motors only really on there.</p>
                                
                                <p>I can understand why some brands I like, and use are not on here because of the average person it reaches out to and the target market they reach. I did not see a lot or any high-end car brands or watch brands, just some nicer clothing and technology brands. I do think there should be brands on this list that can easily substitute what is on there.</p>

                                <p>In the digital age branding and marketing has completely changed. It is very easy to promote and get a brand out there, at least on a platform. It has revolutionized the target market and the volume of people who are able to see your brand and are able to see a particular brand. It does promote the challenge of money and big business will be able to control even more and the huge social media platforms and corporations will have a big say in what and how something is promoted.</p>

                                <h4>Small Business Analysis</h4>
                                <p>Startups and small businesses can compete with larger brands with the write advertising. What is hard for these companies is staying afloat once they make it because you will see larger companies continue to raise their prices until smaller companies are unable to compete and end up losing the store and business because they cannot take the loss of revenue like major companies can.</p>
                                
                                <p>What they can do is move quickly have patents down and be able to market themselves well. If a company is starting up in the right location and the right state where business is they will be able to succeed. With social media in place as well they can get their brand at least known and out there enough before coming into the competitive market.</p>

                                <h4>Consumer Influence Analysis</h4>
                                <p>Consumers impact this form of marketing so greatly especially coming into play nowadays. People are not liking the massive corporations having all this power and control over what is put in our food and what the price for a product is because a monopoly is shorting forming with these massive companies.</p>
                                
                                <p>The consumers impact marketing a lot by making these companies improve their products and change or they will take business somewhere else. The people want something transparent that does not have, for example food a laundry list of ingredients in it and just have something that isn't harmful. As well for products people like unique things not something made 1000 times a day on an assembly line.</p>
